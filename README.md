## üìã Available Tools

IntelliPlan provides a suite of powerful tools to manage your development process:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `batchEpic` | Creates a complete Epic with multiple tasks, each potentially having multiple subtasks, in a single operation. |
| `createEpic` | Creates a new Epic (top-level task) with planning details and optional initial Task creation. |
| `executeItem` | Executes or provides guidance for executing an Epic or Task. |
| `expandTask` | Breaks down a task or epic into smaller, actionable sub-items. |
| `generatePlan` | Generates prompts/guidance for planning, analysis, or handling implementation changes. |
| `getEpicOverview` | Provides a detailed, easy-to-read overview of an Epic, its tasks, and related information. |
| `manageItems` | Manages Epics, Tasks, and Subtasks with various operations (create, update, delete, etc.). |
| `manageTaskStorage` | Manages the storage configuration and exports for Epics and Tasks. |
| `planEpic` | Interactively creates a detailed implementation plan with hierarchical tasks and subtasks through sequential thinking, guiding the agent through multiple steps of refinement. |

## üéÆ Usage Examples

```
# Set up your project storage
@IntelliPlanMCP manageItems action=configure basePath="/path/to/your/project"

# Create a new epic
@IntelliPlanMCP createEpic description="Build user authentication system with JWT"

# Add a task to your epic
@IntelliPlanMCP manageItems action=createTask epicId=your-epic-id description="Implement login endpoint"

# Get an overview of all your epics
@IntelliPlanMCP manageItems action=listEpics

# Generate an implementation plan for a task
@IntelliPlanMCP generatePlan planType=implementation taskId=your-task-id

# Create a complete epic with nested tasks in a single operation
@IntelliPlanMCP batchEpic description="Multi-tenant user authentication" basePath="/path/to/project" tasks=[...]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install IntelliPlan**: 
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Configure in Cursor**: Add to your `.cursor-settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "IntelliPlanMCP": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["path/to/dist/index.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Enable & Start Planning**: Activate MCP in your editor settings and start organizing your development process!

## üîç Why IntelliPlan?

Unlike traditional task managers that live outside your development environment, IntelliPlan works right where you code. This integration eliminates context switching and keeps your planning tightly coupled with implementation.

IntelliPlan's AI capabilities go beyond simple task tracking - it understands the structure of your project and provides intelligent suggestions for implementation, testing strategies, and complexity analysis.
